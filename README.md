## Installation

Since ReaLearn v1.10.0, the preferred and easiest way of installing ReaLearn is via [ReaPack](https://reapack.com/), a
sort of "app store" for REAPER. It allows you to keep your installation of ReaLearn up-to-date very easily.

1. Install [ReaPack](https://reapack.com/) if not done so already
2. Extensions â†’ ReaPack â†’ Import repositories...
3. Copy and paste the following repository URL:
   https://github.com/helgoboss/reaper-packages/raw/master/index.xml
4. Extensions â†’ ReaPack â†’ Browse packages...
5. Search for `realearn`
6. Right mouse click on the ReaLearn entry â†’ Install...
7. OK or Apply
8. Restart REAPER

If you are more the download type of person, you can find the latest `dll`s, `dylib`s and `so`s here at
GitHub on the [releases page](https://github.com/helgoboss/realearn/releases).

## Usage

ReaLearn is fired up just like any other VST instrument in REAPER: By adding it to an FX chain.

### Basics

ReaLearn is written in the programming language [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). It makes heavy use of
[reaper-rs](https://github.com/helgoboss/reaper-rs), which provides Rust bindings for the
[REAPER C++ API](https://www.reaper.fm/sdk/plugin/plugin.php). _reaper-rs_ was developed together with ReaLearn
but is designed as independent library that can be used for REAPER plug-ins of all sorts.

Another noteworthy dependency and byproduct of ReaLearn is [helgoboss-learn](https://github.com/helgoboss/helgoboss-learn), a crate which
provides DAW-agnostic MIDI learn logic (basically the _source_ and _mode_ parts of ReaLearn). Like _reaper-rs_, it's
designed as independent library and could be used to provide similar MIDI-learn functionality in other DAWs.

### Build

#### Windows

In the following you will find the complete instructions for Windows 10, including Rust setup. Points where you have to consider the target
architecture (REAPER 32-bit vs. 64-bit) are marked with :star:.

1. Setup "Build tools for Visual Studio 2019"
   - Rust uses native build toolchains. On Windows, it's necessary to use the MSVC (Microsoft Visual Studio
     C++) toolchain because REAPER plug-ins only work with that.
   - [Visual Studio downloads](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) â†’ All downloads â†’ Tools for Visual Studio 2019
     â†’ Build Tools for Visual Studio 2019
   - Start it and follow the installer instructions
   - Required components
     - Workloads tab
       - "C++ build tools" (large box on the left)
       - Make sure "Windows 10 SDK" is checked on the right side (usually it is)
     - Language packs
       - English
2. Setup Rust
   - [Download](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and execute `rustup-init.exe`
   - Accept the defaults
   - Set the correct toolchain default :star:
     ```batch
     rustup default nightly-2020-05-15-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
     ```
3. Download and install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
4. Clone the ReaLearn Git repository
   ```batch
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/helgoboss/realearn.git`
   cd realearn
   ```
5. Build ReaLearn (after that you should have a `realearn.dll` in `target\debug`)
   ```batch
   cargo build
   ```

#### Linux

Complete instructions to build ReaLearn from a _fresh_ Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS installation,
including Rust setup:

```sh
# Install native dependencies
sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl git build-essential pkg-config php nasm llvm-dev libclang-dev clang xorg-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-render0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev -y

# Install Rust (copied from the official Linux installation instructions)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh # choose 1 (default)
source $HOME/.cargo/env

# Set the correct toolchain default
rustup default nightly-2020-05-15-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu

# Clone ReaLearn repository (the "--recurse-submodules" is important!)
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/helgoboss/realearn.git
cd realearn

# Build (after that you should have a "librealearn.so" in "target/debug")
cargo build
```

Some words about the native dependencies:

- `curl`, `git`, `build-essential` and `pkg-config` are bare essentials.
- `php` is needed to translate the ReaLearn dialog resource file to C++ so it can be processed by the SWELL
  dialog generator. It's also necessary for generating the 64-bit EEL assembler code. All of this is the
  typical WDL C++ way of doing things, no Rust specifics here.
- `nasm` is needed for assembling the 64-bit EEL assembler code to produce `asm-nseel-x64.o`, which is
  necessary to make the custom [EEL](https://www.cockos.com/EEL2/) control and feedback transformations in ReaLearn's
  absolute mode work.
- `llvm-dev`, `libclang-dev` and `clang` are necessary for building with feature `generate` (to generate
  bindings to C).
- `xorg-dev` and `libxcb-*` are necessary for clipboard access via
  [clipboard](https://crates.io/crates/clipboard) crate (previously ReaLearn
  [implemented](https://github.com/helgoboss/realearn/commit/c3e28e92b758a42339ebd5997be9a1368decacf4) its own
  clipboard code via SWELL but that had character encoding issues)

#### macOS

The following instructions include Rust setup. However, it's very well possible that some native toolchain setup
instructions are missing, because I don't have a bare macOS installation at my disposal. The Rust installation script
should provide you with the necessary instructions if something is missing.

```sh
# Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh # choose 1 (default)
source $HOME/.cargo/env
# Using nightly is not necessary if you want to build just the low-level or medium-level API!
rustup default nightly-2020-05-15-x86_64-apple-darwin

# Clone ReaLearn
cd Downloads
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/helgoboss/realearn.git
cd realearn

# Build ReaLearn
cargo build
```

#### All operating systems

Regenerate bindings (for dialog resource IDs and EEL functions):

```sh
cargo build --features generate
cargo fmt
```

### Test

Yes, there are some tests. No, not enough ðŸ˜³ While ReaLearn's basic building blocks [helgoboss-learn](https://github.com/helgoboss/helgoboss-learn) 
and [reaper-rs](https://github.com/helgoboss/reaper-rs) are tested pretty thouroughly, ReaLearn itself needs improvement in that aspect. In future, it 
would be nice to have an integration test running directly in REAPER, similar to the one of *reaper-rs*.

### Roadmap

Some short-term goals:

- Remove compile warnings (at the moment, compiling ReaLearn yields lots of warnings)
- Write a basic user guide
- Provide a documentation of ReaLearn's internal design (contributors should know about that)
