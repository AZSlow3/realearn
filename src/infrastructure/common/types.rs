/// # Design
///
/// ## Why `Rc<RefCell<Session>>`?
///
/// `Plugin#get_editor()` must return a Box of something 'static, so it's impossible to take a
/// reference here. Why? Because a reference needs a lifetime. Any non-static lifetime would
/// not satisfy the 'static requirement. Why not require a 'static reference then? Simply
/// because we don't have a session object with static lifetime. The session object is
/// owned by the `Plugin` object, which itself doesn't have a static lifetime. The only way
/// to get a 'static session would be to not let the plugin object own the session but to
/// define a static global. This, however, would be a far worse design than just using a
/// smart pointer here. So using a smart pointer is the best we can do really.
///
/// This is not the only reason why taking a reference here is not feasible. During the
/// lifecycle of a ReaLearn session we need mutable access to the session both from the
/// editor (of course) and from the plugin (e.g. when REAPER wants us to load some data).
/// When using references, Rust's borrow checker wouldn't let that happen. We can't do anything
/// about this multiple-access requirement, it's just how the VST plugin API works (and
/// many other similar plugin interfaces as well - for good reasons). And being a plugin we
/// have to conform.
///
/// Fortunately, we know that actually both DAW-plugin interaction (such as loading data) and
/// UI interaction happens in the main thread, in the so called main loop. So there's no
/// need for using a thread-safe smart pointer here. We even can and also should satisfy
/// the borrow checker, meaning that if the session is mutably accessed at a given point in
/// time, it is not accessed from another point as well. This can happen even in a
/// single-threaded environment because functions can call other functions and thereby
/// accessing the same data - just in different stack positions. Just think of reentrancy.
/// Fortunately this is something we can control. And we should, because when this kind of
/// parallel access happens, this can lead to strange bugs which are particularly hard to
/// find.
///
/// Unfortunately we can't make use of Rust's compile time borrow checker because there's no
/// way that the compiler understands what's going on here. Why? For one thing, because of
/// the VST plugin API design. But first and foremost because we use the FFI, which means
/// we interface with non-Rust code, so Rust couldn't get the complete picture even if the
/// plugin system would be designed in a different way. However, we *can* use Rust's
/// runtime borrow checker `RefCell`. And we should, because it gives us fail-fast
/// behavior. It will let us know immediately when we violated that safety rule.
/// TODO-low We must take care, however, that REAPER will not crash as a result, that would be
/// very  bad.  See https://github.com/RustAudio/vst-rs/issues/122
