/// Represents a displayable logical part of the UI, such as a panel.
///
/// Each view has a 1:0..1 relationship to a window. One can say that a view is
/// implemented/displayed by a window. A window (= HWND) is the more low-level technical
/// implementation concept which has lots of possible behavior (see `Window` struct) whereas a view
/// is a higher-level logical concept which uses window methods to implement very particular and
/// aptly-named logic which makes sense for that part of the UI.
///
/// All views have a few things in common, e.g. views can be opened (window gets created) and closed
/// (window gets destroyed). These common things are modeled by this trait. In addition to a common
/// interface, this trait provides default implementations for that common behavior.
///
/// An other important part of this trait are window events/callbacks, which implementors can
/// handle.
///
/// # Design
///
/// ## Why do view callback methods take self not as mutable reference?
/// win32 window procedures can be *reentered*, see the win32 docs! Now let's assume we would take
/// self as mutable reference (`&mut self`). If we would have a borrow checker (`RefCell`), it would
/// complain on reentry by panicking. Rightly so. Without `RefCell` things would get very unsafe and
/// we wouldn't even get notified about it. I think the only correct way is to never let the window
/// procedure call view methods in a mutable context. Make all view handler methods take an
/// immutable reference. The same strategy which we are using with `IReaperControlSurface` in
/// `reaper-rs`, because this is reentrant as well.
///
/// ## Why are there no exceptions?
/// One could argue that e.g. `WM_INITDIALOG` is not reentered and we could therefore make an
/// exception. But not only the win32 window procedure might call our view, also our own code. Just
/// think of a `close()` method which takes `&mut self` and calls `DestroyWindow()`. Windows would
/// send a `WM_INITDIALOG` message while we are still in the `close()` method, et voil√† ... we would
/// have 2 mutable accesses. It's just not safe and would cause a false feeling of security!
///
/// ## So how do we mutate things in the callback methods?
/// Everything which needs to be mutable needs to be wrapped with a `RefCell`. We need to pursue the
/// fine-granular `RefCell` approach because reentrancy is unavoidable. We just need to make sure
/// not to write to the same data member non-exclusively. If we fail to achieve that, at least
/// the panic lets us know about the issue.
///
/// ## Why do view callback methods take self as `Rc<Self>`?
/// Given the above mentioned safety measures and knowing that we must keep views as `Rc`s anyway
/// (for lifetime reasons, see `ViewManager`), it is possible to take self as `Rc<Self>` without
/// sacrificing anything. The obvious advantage we have is that it gives us an easy way to access
/// view methods in subscribe closures without running into lifetime problems (such as &self
/// disappearing while still being used in the closure).
